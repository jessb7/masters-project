# MSc Project: Bayesian Analysis of the Yule-Simon Distribution

## Synopsis

This repository includes the writing and code from my Master's project at the Univesity of Kent. The project investigated data-augmentation algorithms using simulated data and applications to real data. A two-parameter Yule-Simon distribution was also developed and tested on simulated data.
